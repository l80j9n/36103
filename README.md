SUBJECT OUTLINE 
36103 Statistical Thinking for Data Science 
Subject description 
Statistical thinking   is the foundational mindset in data science,   emphasizing   the   use   of statistical   principles   and methods to understand, analyze, and derive   meaningful   insights from data.   It   serves   as   the   core   of data   science.   This      subject equips students with essential skills and concepts for applying   statistical   thinking   in   the   context   of applied   data   science.   Initially, students are introduced to fundamental statistical   principles, developing   a   simultaneous understanding of modern methods for statistical inference,   and gaining   valuable   hands-on   experience   with   real-world   data. Subsequently, they delve into a   range of   statistical   models   and   estimation techniques,   applying   their   acquired knowledge to engage   in a complete data science   research cycle.   Collaborating   in   teams,   students   learn   how   to formulate research inquiries, employ formal statistics and   real-world   datasets   to   address   them,   and   effectively   communicate their findings through both oral presentations and written   reports. 
The progression of this subject starts with more teaching-intensive   methods   such   as workshops   and   lectures   to   give   students the technical and conceptual know-how to work as   practicing   data   scientists. As   the   subject   progresses, students   increasingly   move towards an   individually driven learning mode,   allowing   both teams   and   individuals   the   flexibility to enhance their statistical thinking and skills. 
Upon completion of the subject, students possess a   robust foundation   in   technical,   conceptual,   and   practical   aspects,   empowering them to continue their development as   Data Scientists.

Teaching and learning strategies 
Authentic problem based learning: This subject   relies   heavily upon the   principle that students   learn   best   by   doing.   It   offers a range of authentic data science   problems to   solve that   help   to   develop   students’   statistical   thinking   about complex   problems. Students work on real world data analysis   problems   using   datasets that   they   create   using   modern   data   harvesting techniques. These are used to answer realistic   data   science   questions   in   broad   areas   of topical interest. This exposes them to the true ambiguities, constraints, and   complexities   of working   as   a   data scientist   for   a   variety of different stakeholders. 
Blend of online and face to face activities: This subject   is offered   through   a   series   of   block   sessions   blending   online   with face-to-face learning. Students interact face-to-face with each   other   and the   teaching   team   in   three   intensive modules that require the completion of both   preparation and   after   class   activities.   They   concurrently   use   a   range   of   complementary online resources to develop their statistical thinking   according   to   identified weaknesses   in   their background   knowledge. They are expected to engage in   online   discussion   and to   actively   participate   in   other   blended   activities. 
Collaborative work: We place a strong emphasis on   group   activities   and   collaboration   in   diverse   teams. As   a   data science   professional you   need to approach professional projects and   challenges   by working with   people   from   different      backgrounds, expectations, and expertise. This course simulates that   environment   by   requiring   students to work with   a team of peers who come from many different   backgrounds.   Group   assessments   help students   to   develop   ef代 写36103 Statistical Thinking for Data Science Autumn 2024Python

Self paced evaluation and improvement: This subject takes students from an   exceptionally wide   range   of backgrounds, some of who are better versed in statistical   methods,   and   Python,   than   others.   We   help   all   students   to self-diagnose their weaknesses and strengths, and to work to improve   in   areas that   they   identify   as   a   priority   for   the professional   niche that they would like to occupy as a   practicing   data   scientist.   Students   choose   their   own   path   through   a wide variety of curated resources as   needed. Embedding English Language: An aim of this subject   is to help you   develop   academic   and   professional   language         and communication skills in order to succeed at   university   and   in   the workplace.   To   determine   your   current   academic   language   proficiency, you are required to complete an online   language   screening   task,   OPELA   (information   available   at

These tutorials   are   designed to   support   you   to   develop   your language and communication skills. Students who do   not complete   the   OPELA   and/or   do   not   attend   80%   of the   Language   Development Tutorials will receive a   Fail X grade 
Assessment 
This subject is 100% coursework based with no exams. A detailed assessment brief is available on canvas detailing each assessment task, please refer to this throughout the course. 
Assessments are a blend of individual and team-based work. 
Assessment task 1: Exploration of data skills and issues 
Objective(s): 3 and   5 Type: Report
Groupwork: Individual Weight: 20%
Task: This assessment is intended   to   conduct   exploratory   data   analysis   (EDA)   on   a   marketing   campaign
dataset from a telecommunication company. A telecommunication company recently   launched a
marketing campaign to promote the adoption of their new   subscription   plan   among   customers.   The   company seeks assistance in gaining a comprehensive   understanding   of their customers   and
identifying the customer segments that display the highest   responsiveness to   marketing   campaigns.      The response variable, subscribed, indicates whether the client   subscribed to   a   new   plan, which was   the objective of the campaign.
The dataset   may   have   issues such   missing   information and data errors.   Identifying and   handling   such   issues   is   part of the   assessment.
The requirements involve applying a   minimum of three distinct   exploratory   data   analysis   techniques   to gain preliminary   insights from the   data.
